The `jamesdemodata` is a lightweight repo with demo and test children. The goal 
of the package is to test the 
**Joint Automatic Measurement and Evaluation System (JAMES)**.
JAMES is an **experimental** online resource for creating and analysing
growth charts.

## Installation

The following statements will install the `jamesdemodata` package

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("growthcharts/jamesdemodata")
```

## Example

Test- en demo data are stored in the `inst/extdata` directory. In order to generate a file name of the SMOCC child Laura S use 

```{r eval=FALSE}

```

Read the data into R using the `bdsreader` package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(bdsreader)
tgt <- read_bds(fn)
head(tgt)
persondata(tgt)
```

See <https://github.com/growthcharts/bdsreader> for installation notes of `bdsreader`.
